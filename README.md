# learning_pytorch_from_a_course
To keep track of my PyTorch progress. 

I recently started learning PyTorch with an online course: https://jovian.ai/aakashns/01-pytorch-basics

In this github repository, I am tracking my progress by uploading project files. Nothing really cool in here since I do not do it myself.
